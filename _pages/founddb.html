  <p>
  Modern cloud-based data analytics systems must efficiently process petabytes of data residing on cloud storage.
  A key optimization technique in state-of-the-art systems like Snowflake is partition pruning&mdash;skipping chunks of data that do not contain relevant information for computing query results.
  </p>
  <p>
  While partition pruning based on query predicates is a well-established technique, we demonstrate that its scope can be extended to <code>LIMIT</code>, top-k, and <code>JOIN</code> operations, dramatically expanding the opportunities for pruning across diverse query types.
  </p>
  <p>
  Our analysis of Snowflake's production workloads reveals that real-world analytical queries exhibit much higher selectivity than commonly assumed, yielding effective partition pruning.
  We show that we can harness high selectivity by utilizing only min/max metadata available in modern data analytics systems and data lake formats like Apache Iceberg, reducing the number of processed micro-partitions by 99.4%.

<h2>Highlights</h2>

<p>We presented four data pruning techniques that are used in the Snowflake data platform and evaluated them based on their pruning effectiveness on real-world customer workloads.
The pruning flow is as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>First, all queries containing a <code>WHERE</code> predicate are subject to <em>filter pruning</em>, which removes data partitions by identifying the ones that do not contain any rows that would match the filter condition in the <code>WHERE</code> clause.</li>
  <li>If the query is a simple <code>LIMIT</code> query without an <code>ORDER BY</code>, the query engine tries to reduce the number of partitions to the minimally necessary set of partitions such that the query result can be computed. This works for queries with and without <code>WHERE</code> clause.</li>
  <li>While executing a join, the probe side of a join is subject to <em>join pruning</em>, i.e., removing partitions from the probe side that do not contain join partners based on the collected values from the build side.</li>
  <li>Lastly, if a query is a top-k query, i.e., it contains an <code>ORDER BY ... LIMIT</code>, a specialized <em>top-k pruning</em> technique attempts to reduce the number of processed partitions by pushing runtime information about the current top-k heap down to the table scan.</li>
</ol>
<p>While the first two techniques can be applied during query optimization, the latter two techniques require runtime information about the current state of the query execution.</p>
